 * Official `@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm`, `opfs-sahpool` VFS, in a worker.

 * The fastest thing measured on a real phone: reads 2.5-5.5x and batched writes ~9x against the
 * Capacitor bridge, with much tighter worst cases. The SAH pool is chosen over the plain `opfs` VFS
 * because it needs neither SharedArrayBuffer nor cross-origin isolation, and a Capacitor WebView
 * cannot easily be given COOP/COEP headers.
